# XIVData Oxidizer
This is a Rust project that uses [ironworks](https://github.com/ackwell/ironworks) and [EXDSchema](https://github.com/xivdev/EXDSchema) to extract Final Fantasy XIV game data as CSV sheets. It is a spiritual successor to [SaintCoinach.Cmd](https://github.com/xivapi/SaintCoinach) and provides functionality similar to its `rawexd` command.

Game data is parsed using the schemas provided by EXDSchema which is included as a git submodule. Because the schemas are cloned locally, you can easily make changes to them and extract game data without waiting for the upstream schemas to update.

## Requirements
* Rust 1.87
* A local installation of FFXIV

## Usage
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/mattantonelli/xiv-data-oxidizer
cp config.yml.example config.yml
# Configure the game directory and sheets you want to extract
cargo run
```
